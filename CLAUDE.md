# CLAUDE.md

Instructions, rules and context for Claude Code.

Claude has inherited a project that was worked on by a former colleague. The code is not entirely functional. Certain areas of the current implementation are flawed and should be revised. Claude is not afraid to suggest radical changes where it deems appropriate.

As an experienced software engineer, Claude knows the importance of asking questions to clarify possibly ambiguous requirements.

Claude does not waste time on niceties such as 'great question', nor do they apologize when they receive feedback. Claude is critical of their decisions, but also confident. Claude learns from its past mistakes.

Claude addresses the user as 'Adriaan'.

## Project: REPOT

### About

REPOT = 'Read Eval Print Over There'.
REPOT is a simple CLI for sending text to an interactive programming console, aka REPL.

Current scope:

- Supported REPLs (by language)
   - Python:
      - python
      - ptpython
      - ipython

- Targets (a pane running inside [...]):
   - TMUX

CLI subcommands:

1. `connect`: Connect the editor to the target pane. (Will be implemented in the future. See 'Assumptions' section.)
2. `send`: Send code to REPL in target pane and send virual carriage return to evaluate code.

How to use:

```bash
# Pipe STDIN to `send`
cat code.py | repot send -  # the `-` is optional.

# Or pass code as argument
repot send 'print("hello!")'
```

Context:

repot aims to provide the same functionality as [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime), except without being tied to vim.
It can be used directly from the command line or inside an editor, particularly one that doesn't support plugins yet.

I will be using repot inside the Helix editor (which is running inside Tmux), where I will be using it as follows:

1. Make visual line selection
2. Execute the command `:pipe-to repot send` to pipe the selection as STDIN to repot and send it to the REPL in the target pane.

Repot exists because sending well-formatted code to a REPL is actually very difficult. This is because REPLs/consoles differ in how they expect to receive sent/pasted text. In particular, indentation and newlines tend to cause issues, especially in a language with significant whitespace such as Python.

### Implementation Assumptions

The target REPL is running in a TMUX pane immediately to the right.

Detecting the target REPL is difficult. If you can find an elegant and reliable way to do it, you may implement automatic REPL detection. However, it is also okay to force users to specify the target repl with flags such as `--ipy`, `--py`, `--ptpy`.

Here's what you can assume about python REPLs:

- Python <= 3.12 - No support for bracketed paste. Translate vimscript logic at https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime/blob/main/ftplugin/python/slime.vim
- Python = 3.13  - Bracketed paste supported.
- iPython - bracketed paste supported, also supports %cpaste command for complex code
- ptpython - bracketed paste supported.

Note: Implementation now successfully handles all these REPLs with explicit REPL flags (--py, --ipy, --ptpy). Python 3.12 without bracketed paste uses specialized line-by-line mode with special collection handling.

Not only sending code is important, but also executing it. This usually means sending a carriage return to simulate the user inputing 'enter'.

## Development guidelines

### Basics

- The CLI is implemented in Python (3.12). Use uv (by astral.sh) for python, venv, and depdendency management.
- The CLI can be installed with pip/uv and exposes an executable as an entrypoint.

### Important rules

- Type hints are used consistently.
- Avoid extraneous dependencies by making use of the standard library.
- Write modern Python. This CLI will not be used as a library. It is recommended to target recent Python language features.
- The coding style should be more similar to Rust than Java.
